[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rosatolen/LeanStraTreegery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rosatolen/LeanStraTreegery)

Coding in this repository depends on npm (the JavaScript package manager).

# Install Dependencies
For tests on OSX High Sierra, you'll want to install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html). Watchman allows the Jest test runner to run continuously in the background and run the tests whenever a source file is changed. The easiest way is with `brew install watchman`.

Next, install the app dependencies with `npm install`

# Run Tests
```
npm test
```

# Start the App Locally
```
npm start
```
